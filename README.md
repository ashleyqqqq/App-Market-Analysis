# Project Title: App Market Analysis

+ **Project summary**: When you want to download an App on your iphone, most of you may look through some reviews, especially that App is paid. Do you prefer to look 5 star reviews or 1 star reviews? Which one is helpful for you? 
After you get clear about all of its strength and drawbacks. You decide to pay $4.99 and download it. You feel it is good, but when your friend who use Samsung tells you he download it by free, you become angry soon. How could this happen? They are a same app ! My friend use Android mobile phone, he prefer same apps as me, but for all Ios and Android customers, are their preference the same? Where are those developers living? If they address is close to me, I need to knock their door and tell them to update soon because this app cannot fill my new iphone XS plusâ€™s screen...... 
People use mobile phone so frequently, and this lead to many interesting questions. In this project, we focus on finding the answer of those interesting questions to you.
